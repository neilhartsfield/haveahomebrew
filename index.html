    <h3>Making the Wort</h3>
    <ul id="wort">
        <li>Clean brew kettle with soap and water.</li>
        <li>Filter enough water (3+ gallons) through the Berkey to use for wort base.</li>
        <li>Add crushed caramel 30L malt (453g) and crushed biscuit malt (227g). Steep for 20 minutes at ~165F.</li>
        <li>Remove grain bag and bring wort to rolling boil. Add DME and LME.</li>
        <li>Once boil is rolling again, add 28g of Chinook hop pellets (alpha acid 12%).</li>
        <li>After 20 minutes, add 28g more of Chinook hop pellets.</li>
        <li>After 20 more minutes, add 28g of Cascade hop pellets (alpha acid 6.9%)</li>
        <li>During these last 20 minutes of the boil, fill sink with cold water and add either ice or icepacks.</li>
        <li>Terminate the boil after ~60 minutes and chill wort to < 120F</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sanitization</h3>
      <div>
        <ul id="sanitize">
        <li>Once the malt has steeped and the brew kettle is rolling, mix 1 Tbsp of One Step per 1 gallon of warm water in the glass carboy which will be later used for fermentation.</li>
        <li>Pour cleanser mixture from carboy into a brew bucket containing the rest of the brewing equipment (e.g. airlock, hydrometer, floating thermometer, rubber stopper, hoses, scissors, yeast packet, etc.)</li>
        <li>Allow to soak for a little bit and remove equipment to air dry.</li>
    </ul>
      </div>




    <h3>Staging Fermentation</h3>
    <div class="flexcontainer">
      <div>
        <img src="./pics/airlock.gif" alt="Airlock bubbling" style="float: left;">
       </div>
    <ul id="fermentation" style="overflow: hidden; list-style: outside disc; margin-left: 1em;">
        <li>Add 2.5 gallons of cold water to the 6 gallon glass carboy.</li>
        <li>Pour the chilled wort through a filtered funnel into the carboy.</li>
        <p><i>Note: I had to repeatedly move/mix the sludge from the hop pellets that would stick at the bottom of the funnel, causing a block. Next time I'll either use a jumbo strain bag to line a brew bucket with, pour the chilled wort into the brew bucket, and then lift the strain bag out; pour the strained wort into the carboy. Or, wrap a small nut-milk bag around the end of a racking cane and siphon the wort from the brew kettle directly into the carboy.</i></p>
        <li>Take original gravity (OG) once the wort dips below 80F. It was hot today so I took the reading at 80F (and thus needed to add ~0.005 to my reading).</li>
        <li>After the initial gravity reading, pitch the yeast into the carboy and mix it thoroughly (I didn't have any sanitized utensil to stir with, so I used my racking cane.</li>
        <li>Plug the 6 gallon carboy with a rubber stopper and slap an airlock filled up halfway with water in the center hole (pictured left).</li>
        <li>Place the carboy in a cool, dark place (my office closet).</li>
    </ul>
